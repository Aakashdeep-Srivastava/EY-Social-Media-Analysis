# EY Battle of BrainPower BI Challenge 2024 - Marketing Campaign Analysis

## üìã Problem Statement
An analytics consultancy firm needed to optimize social media campaigns across multiple companies using Power BI dashboards to enhance conversion rates, minimize acquisition costs, and maximize ROI.

### Key Metrics Analyzed:
- Conversion Rate = (Number of Conversions / Number of Clicks)
- Acquisition Cost = Total Cost of Campaign / Number of Customers Acquired
- ROI = (Net Return / Cost)
- Engagement Score (1-10 scale)
- Click-Through Rate (CTR) = (Clicks/Impressions)
